Ok let's see where the ship is,,
Oh there's my ship!,,
"Wait, it's only the hull!!",,
At least tell me the healing system is still working,,
Get inside the ship to heal by pressing A,,
It works!,,
"I mean I wouldn't know, since I wasn't hurt, but it seems to be intact!",,
That's probably the only thing working right now.,,
"The teleport antenna isn't there, the gun is nowhere to be seen,",,
and none of the jets are present. Also the dome is missing!,,
"If I wanna get home and also not be fired, I'm gonna have to find every component and get the hell out.",,
But let's begin by repairing this mess first,,
"Exit the ship with A, once outside, repair by holding X (you can't repair if you've just been hurt)",,
Now that's more like it!,,
"It's still a useless potato, but at least now it's not on the brink of falling apart!",,
Let's see if we can find the rest of the ship components,,
Also I've no idea how to say this without sounding weird but you can pause by pressing ENTER,,
The REAR JET will allow the ship to move horizontally,,
The UP JET will allow the ship to move UP (yes!),,
The DOWN JET will allow the ship to move DOWN,,
The GUN will allow the ship to GUN,,
"Finally, we don't have to worry about oxygen if the ship has this thing",,
"That's the teleporter antenna!!, if I put it on the ship I'll be able to teleport by pressing S",,
"Great, now if I'm away from the ship, I can get back to it by pressing S",,
"Hell yes!!, now we can actually FLY, I can't leave yet though, since there's no Dome to keep the air inside the ship",,
Well that's it! I'm done here,,
Let's power the ship and get out,,
...,,
"Oh right, the bio samples.",,
"Ok, let's just uhhhh",,
let's collect 10 flowers and call it a day,,
I conveniently got a flower radar in this thing so let's just get it over with,,
"Some dots have appeared on the border of the screen, just follow them to find the flowers!",,
"Oh right, the FTL Drive.",,
No I'm just kidding I got no idea what that is,,
Ok let's bounce,,
Something's wrong,,
"Ok, let's see if we can get the ship to move",,
I feel like I've awakened something,,
"Great, this jet will allow us to dive into deep waters, now for the Dome and we're good to go!",,
Now we can fend for ourselves.,,
"Shoot with X, hold to fix aim, tap to shoot faster, and remember: you cannot fire when you've just been hurt!",,
Oh look! some locals! Maybe we can talk to them by pressing X!,,
"Hey! I'm an alien, but I come in peace!",,
"I'm here by accident in fact,",,
and am kind of stranded right now.,,
Could you help me find my ship?,,
"Wow, won't even stop and look at me.",,
Whatever.,,
Rude ass.,,
Maybe I don't come in peace.,,
Nothing. It's like I'm talking to a wall here.,,
Maybe they can't hear me?,,
Yeah it's probably that,,
I'm sorry for calling you rude if that's the case,,
"Ok, uhhhh",,
I'm gonna go find my ship now.,,
Good luck with the walking.,,
Ok no talking,,
I better avoid these,,
"And so he bounced, he bounced as hard as he could",,
But he couldn't leave.,,
What the..?,,
Did I just land on my head?,,
"No, this is a ceiling.",,
Why is there a floating ceiling with water upside down here?,,
"Maybe I didn't notice it the first time, what with the crash and all that.",,
"Anyway, let's look for a way around this thing so we can finally leave.",,
"Wow, this place seems to be huge!",,
I think,,
"I think we are trapped, which makes no sense.",,
"Man, how the hell did I end up in this mess.",,
You cannot leave this place,,
Who's there?,,
Hey! It's you! You are the giant rock that hit my ship!,,
I apologize for the suffering and false hope I have caused you.,,
I am the guardian of this world.,,
You were never meant to survive our first encounter.,,
What? why? What did I even do?,,
Nothing yet,,
"But I know your kind, I know what you are.",,
You are a conqueror's scout.,,
You intend to leave this place to inform other members of your lesser species on the benefits of its colonization.,,
"No man, I'm just here to pick up some flowers.",,
"You see. This is company policy, I work for an alien biology magazine, I collect samples that are used to make articles on how life is on other planets.",,
"But that's as far as we go, most of the time my samples get shelved.",,
I collected samples from about 40 different planets.,,
The craziest thing they ever did with them was feature them on Discovery Channel.,,
I did not understand anything you just said.,,
But it does not matter.,,
"I have no reason to believe you, and lose nothing by being wrong.",,
"When it comes to the life under my protection, I shall take no chances.",,
"...So am I like, gonna die now?",,
"No, quite the contrary.",,
Phew.,,
Wait. What does that mean?,,
You will feed and turn into the life of this world.,,
That sounds really nasty.,,
What if I refuse? Can I refuse?,,
I refuse.,,
It will make no difference.,,
"Yeah, well, I guess we'll see about that.",,
"I am exhausted, I can fight no longer",,
Then maybe let me go and take a nap bozo,,
"No, you will not get your way, I will not let you destroy this place.",,
What are you doing?,,
This is an antinuclear matter bubble,,
It will instantly decompose every living thing it touches.,,
"I shall make it shrink slowly, so you have time to make peace with your demise.",,
"As for me. I am done, along with this planet. We are both going to fade to nothing shortly.",,
What? So that's it? We are both just gonna die and the planet will disappear?,,
Then what the hell was the point of this?,,
"That you will not get to colonize the living beings of my planet, they will die free.",,
"Now I ask you, was it worth it?",,
Was what worth it? You are killing us both over nothing here.,,
I will take that as a negative. Farewell.,,
Dumbass,,
Ok let's get out of here.,,
THE END,,
RESTARTING\n(now you can skip text with X),,
And that's how our hero escaped the evil meteor thing.,,
And since the planet he collected the bio samples from just got completely disintegrated,,
"This whole operation, along with everything he has been through, were pointless.",,
But my boss doesn't know that.,,
But his boss doesn't know that.,,
"So he's just gonna play it cool with the flowers on monday, and see how it goes.",,
"Now he marches home, tired but relieved.",,
He will not be there until 3 in the morning.,,
"He will have to shower and eat, but he will say \""I'm not dealing with that\"" and just go right to sleep.",,
"On monday, he will present the samples, and his boss will congratulate him on the task, but ask where the ship's FTL Drive is.",,
"And our hero will say \""I don't know\""",,
"Wait a second, this is the place I came from, there shouldn't be a wall here!!",,
Dome,,Cúpula
Gun,,Cañón
Teleporter,,Teletransportador
Dive Jet,,Jet de Profundidad
Rear Jet,,Jet Trasero
